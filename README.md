# Sparse Non-Negative CPD (SNNCPD)

## Description

This repository contains MATLAB code for performing Sparse Non-Negative Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (SNNCPD) of 3D tensors using dictionary learning and the NADAM optimizer. The method is particularly useful for decomposing fluorescence tensors and other similar datasets where non-negativity and sparsity are desired.

## Features

- **Sparse Non-Negative CPD**: Efficient decomposition of 3D tensors with non-negativity and sparsity constraints.
- **NADAM Optimizer**: Uses the NADAM optimization algorithm, a variant of ADAM with Nesterov momentum.
- **Automatic Rank Selection**: The algorithm can overestimate the rank and apply L1 regularization to select the best rank.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjustable parameters for learning rate, regularization, and non-negativity constraints.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2016b or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox (for certain functions)
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Add the cloned repository to your MATLAB path:
    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('path_to_your_cloned_repository'));
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Preparing the Data

Load your 3D tensor data into MATLAB. The tensor should be of size `I x J x K`, where `I`, `J`, and `K` represent the dimensions of the data.

### 2. Running the Decomposition

Use the `SNNCPD_gradientNadam` function to perform the decomposition:

```matlab
% Load your tensor data
load('your_tensor_data.mat'); % Assume the tensor is stored in a variable called X

% Set the desired rank
R = 7; % Example rank

% Set the options for SNNCPD
options = createOptions(1, 1, 1.5, 0.9, 0.9, 1e-3);

% Perform the decomposition
[A, B, C, Da, Db, Va, Vb, hist, MU] = SNNCPD_gradientNadam(X, R, options);
displaycomponent(A, B, 4); % Display the first 4 components

% Define a grid of parameters 
param_grid.step = [1e-1, 1e-2, 1e-3];
param_grid.beta1 = [0.9, 0.95];
param_grid.beta2 = [0.9, 0.99];
param_grid.alpha = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0];

% Run the optimization to find the best parameters
[best_A, best_B, best_C, best_params, best_hist] = optimize_SNNCPD(X, R, param_grid);

% The best parameters found
disp(best_params);

## Online Sparse Non-Negative CPD (OSNNCPD1)

### Overview

This repository includes an implementation of the Online Sparse Non-Negative Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (OSNNCPD1) algorithm. This method is designed to handle the dynamic decomposition of 3D tensors in an online manner, where new data is continuously arriving. The algorithm efficiently updates factor matrices without the need to recompute the entire decomposition from scratch for each new data point.

### Algorithm Details

The OSNNCPD1 algorithm is based on the method described in the paper:

- **Isaac Wilfried Sanou, Roland Redon, Xavier Luciani, and St√©phane Mounier**. *Online Non-Negative and Sparse Canonical Polyadic Decomposition of Fluorescence Tensors*. Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 225:104550, 2022.

The algorithm involves two phases:

1. **Initialization Phase**: 
   - The initial tensor data is decomposed using the Sparse Non-Negative CPD (SNNCPD) method, establishing the initial factor matrices.

2. **Online Update Phase**: 
   - For each new incoming tensor, the factor matrices are updated online using the factor matrices from the previous step as initializations.
   - Non-negativity constraints and sparsity are enforced during the optimization process using the NADAM optimizer, which efficiently handles the gradient updates.

### Usage

#### 1. Preparing the Data

Load your initial tensor data and set the rank. The online algorithm will begin by decomposing this initial data.

```matlab
% Load initial tensor data
load('initial_tensor_data.mat'); % Assume the tensor is stored in a variable called T0

% Set the desired rank
R = 7; % Example rank

% Initialize the algorithm with the first tensor
[A0, B0, C0, Da0, Db0, Va0, Vb0, hist, MU] = OSNNCPD1_gradientNadam(T0, R);
